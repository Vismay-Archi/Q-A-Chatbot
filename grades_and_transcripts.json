    "The following grades are given to graduate students and count in calculating a student’s cumulative GPA as noted by quality hours. GPA is calculated by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of graded semester or quarter hours. Courses not taken at Illinois Institute of Technology are not included in computing the GPA. Students may access their grades online in the Illinois Tech Portal (portal.iit.edu), under the Academics tab.",
    "The incomplete (I) grade is a temporary grade that must be requested in writing by the student to the instructor of record using theIncomplete Grade Request Form.",
    "Applicable only to approved research courses, the grade of “R” may be assigned for students who have not completed research work in the course. Once assigned, the grade of “R” will remain on the student’s transcript until the research as determined by the research professor is completed and changed to a final grade of Satisfactory (\"S\") or Unsatisfactory (\"U\"). The grade of \"R\" does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program.",
    "A grade of \"NA'' indicates a student never attended classes, lectures and/or lab sessions of a course and there was no apparent participation by the student in that course. As of Fall 2023, the \"NA'' grade is an option for midterm and final grades for both undergraduate and graduate courses and is equivalent to the failing grade of \"E'' for GPA calculations.",
    "The withdrawal grade is issued to students who withdraw from a class after the last day to add and drop classes. The “W” cannot be changed to a standard letter grade and does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program.",
    "Satisfactory (“S”) and unsatisfactory (“U”) grades are only used for the following courses: 591 (Research and Thesis), 594 (Project and Report), 691 (Research and Thesis), noncredit courses, and individual courses specifically approved to receive such grades. A student who receives a “U” in course numbers 591, 594, or 691 must demonstrate to his or her adviser, academic unit head, and the Graduate College, Office of Academic Affairs why he or she should be allowed to continue as a graduate student. Students registered for course number 597 are not eligible for “S/U” grades. “S/U” grades are not used in calculating the GPA. The grade of \"U\" does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program.",
    "Auditing of courses is discouraged, but a student may do so if the student has taken the necessary prerequisites, if the student’s presence does not exclude a student who wishes to enroll for credit, and if the student’s presence does not distract from the conduct of the course as determined by the instructor. An auditor must pay full tuition for the course but is not held for examinations and does not receive credit. Auditors may not change their registration to receive credit after the the add/drop deadline. The “AU” grade issued for an audited course can never be changed, used for graduate credit, or for fulfillment of degree requirements at the university.",
    "The change of grade request form is available only to faculty and authorized academic administrators in the Illinois Tech Portal under the Registrar Services tab > Registrar - Faculty Resources drop-down. Temporary grades of \"I\", \"R\", and \"X\" can be changed by the instructor directly with the Office of the Registrar to a final letter grade of: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", or \"S/U\" (if the class has a grading basis of satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Temporary grades of \"I\" or \"R\" cannot be changed by the instructor to another temporary or non-letter, administrative grade of \"I\", \"R\", \"NA\", \"AU\", \"W\", or \"X\". Other grade changes may require an additional level of approval by an academic officer or appeals committee. The student should check with his or her academic college dean's office for details.",
    "The assignment of letter grades is at the discretion of the course instructor, and except for unusual circumstances, the assigned course grade is final.",
    "Students who want to appeal a letter grade assigned in a course should first confer directly with the course instructor. If the student and instructor cannot come to an agreement, the student should contact the chair of the instructor’s department. If necessary, the student can appeal to the dean of the instructor’s college. If a grade dispute is not resolved through this process, the decision of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs shall be final, upon review of the matter.",
    "All grade changes must be initiated by the instructor of record or the authorized academic administrator using the online Change of Grade Request Form available in the Registrar Services tab > Registrar - Faculty Resources drop-down of the Illinois Tech Portal. Emails and paper forms are not accepted.",
    "A final grade (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"AU\", \"P\", \"F\", \"S\", \"U\", \"NG\", or \"W\") cannot be changed to a temporary grade (\"I\", \"R\", or \"X\"). For more information regarding the grade marks, consult the officialGrade Legend.",
    "Grade changes submitted within four weeks of the end date of the term require only the approval of the instructor. Grade changes submitted after four weeks of the end date of the term will require additional approvals from the department chair, academic college dean, and vice provost for Academic Affairs.",

Once remaining requirements have been completed, the instructor must submit a Change of Grade Request Form (available under the Registrar Services tab > Registrar - Faculty Resources of the Illinois Tech Portal) to change the incomplete grade to a final grade by the deadline indicated on the Academic Calendar . Any remaining incomplete grades will automatically be converted to a failing grade (E, U, or F). If additional time is needed to complete the remaining requirements, students may request an extension with the instructor. If approved, the instructor will contact the Office of the Registrar to apply the extension (7th Monday of the following semester, excluding summer). Only one extension can be granted. If the extension is granted, then the instructor will be allowed to submit the Change of Grade Request Form by the new (extended) deadline as indicated on the Academic Calendar. The instructor cannot request that an incomplete grade be given for a student without the student first requesting it. If there is no request by the student, then the incomplete grade will not be applied. Research (“R”) Grade Applicable only to approved research courses, the grade of “R” may be assigned for students who have not completed research work in the course. Once assigned, the grade of “R” will remain on the student’s transcript until the research as determined by the research professor is completed and changed to a final grade of Satisfactory (\"S\") or Unsatisfactory (\"U\"). The grade of \"R\" does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program. Non-Attendance (“NA”) Grade A grade of \"NA'' indicates a student never attended classes, lectures and/or lab sessions of a course and there was no apparent participation by the student in that course. As of Fall 2023, the \"NA'' grade is an option for midterm and final grades for both undergraduate and graduate courses and is equivalent to the failing grade of \"E'' for GPA calculations. Withdrawal (“W”) Grade The withdrawal grade is issued to students who withdraw from a class after the last day to add and drop classes. The “W” cannot be changed to a standard letter grade and does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program. Satisfactory (“S”) and Unsatisfactory (“U”) Grades Satisfactory (“S”) and unsatisfactory (“U”) grades are only used for the following courses: 591 (Research and Thesis), 594 (Project and Report), 691 (Research and Thesis), noncredit courses, and individual courses specifically approved to receive such grades. A student who receives a “U” in course numbers 591, 594, or 691 must demonstrate to his or her adviser, academic unit head, and the Graduate College, Office of Academic Affairs why he or she should be allowed to continue as a graduate student. Students registered for course number 597 are not eligible for “S/U” grades. “S/U” grades are not used in calculating the GPA. The grade of \"U\" does not fulfill the requirements of a graduate program. Audit (“AU”) grade Auditing of courses is discouraged, but a student may do so if the student has taken the necessary prerequisites, if the student’s presence does not exclude a student who wishes to enroll for credit, and if the student’s presence does not distract from the conduct of the course as determined by the instructor. An auditor must pay full tuition for the course but is not held for examinations and does not receive credit. Auditors may not change their registration to receive credit after the the add/drop deadline. The “AU” grade issued for an audited course can never be changed, used for graduate credit, or for fulfillment of degree requirements at the university. Change of Grade and grade appeal The change of grade request form is available only to faculty and authorized academic administrators in the Illinois Tech Portal under the Registrar Services tab > Registrar - Faculty Resources drop-down. Temporary grades of \"I\", \"R\", and \"X\" can be changed by the instructor directly with the Office of the Registrar to a final letter grade of: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", or \"S/U\" (if the class has a grading basis of satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Temporary grades of \"I\" or \"R\" cannot be changed by the instructor to another temporary or non-letter, administrative grade of \"I\", \"R\", \"NA\", \"AU\", \"W\", or \"X\". Other grade changes may require an additional level of approval by an academic officer or appeals committee. The student should check with his or her academic college dean's office for details. The assignment of letter grades is at the discretion of the course instructor, and except for unusual circumstances, the assigned course grade is final. Students who want to appeal a letter grade assigned in a course should first confer directly with the course instructor. If the student and instructor cannot come to an agreement, the student should contact the chair of the instructor’s department. If necessary, the student can appeal to the dean of the instructor’s college. If a grade dispute is not resolved through this process, the decision of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs shall be final, upon review of the matter. All grade changes must be initiated by the instructor of record or the authorized academic administrator using the online Change of Grade Request Form available in the Registrar Services tab > Registrar - Faculty Resources drop-down of the Illinois Tech Portal. Emails and paper forms are not accepted. A final grade (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"AU\", \"P\", \"F\", \"S\", \"U\", \"NG\", or \"W\") cannot be changed to a temporary grade (\"I\", \"R\", or \"X\"). For more information regarding the grade marks, consult the official Grade Legend . Grade changes submitted within four weeks of the end date of the term require only the approval of the instructor. Grade changes submitted after four weeks of the end date of the term will require additional approvals from the department chair, academic college dean, and vice provost for Academic Affairs.
