  "text": "Co-terminal degrees are awarded simultaneously, and students may not receive their first degree before the requirements of the second degree are satisfied. In such cases, the conferral of the first degree will be held until the completion of the second degree. In the last semester of their co-terminal degree studies, students must apply for undergraduate graduation by the published deadline in the academic calendar or a late fee will be assessed. The Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs will convey the co-terminal graduation application information to the Office of Graduate Academic Affairs. To apply for graduation, please visit the myIIT Portal at my.iit.edu. Choose the “Academics” tab, followed by the “Student Records” link. You may then select “Apply to Graduate.” Commencement Graduating co-terminal students may attend the main commencement ceremony and one departmental commencement ceremony. Accordingly, those students receiving degrees from two different academic units will need to choose which departmental ceremony to attend.",
