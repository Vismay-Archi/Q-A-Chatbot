  "text": "Co-terminal degrees allow Illinois Tech students to simultaneously complete both an undergraduate and graduate degree (Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree). Co-terminal students maintain their undergraduate student status while completing graduate coursework, and can maintain financial aid eligibility when applicable. Co-terminal degrees provide an opportunity for students to gain greater knowledge in specialized areas while completing a smaller number of credit hours with increased scheduling flexibility than the completion of two degrees separately. Because most co-terminal degrees allow students to share course credit (a maximum of nine credit hours), students may complete both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in as few as five years. All degree requirements must be completed within six years of undergraduate matriculation, or the student will be dismissed from the co-terminal degree program. Please consult the Graduate Bulletin for a list of legacy co-terminal degree pairings: http://bulletin.iit.edu/graduate/graduate-education/academic-programs/. Students may also work with advisers to identify alternate bachelor's and master's degree pairings, pending the approval of the prospective graduate program and the student's undergraduate program. 3 Updated September 2020",
