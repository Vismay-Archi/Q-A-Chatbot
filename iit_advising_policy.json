    "Before registration, all undergraduate students must receive approval from their faculty adviser. All add/drop requests, except for change of section, also require adviser approval. The faculty adviser will provide the student with a PIN (also referred to as an alternate PIN), which will be used in registering for courses in the Illinois Tech portal.",
    "Graduate students are encouraged to consult with a faculty adviser prior to registration. All graduate students registering for research courses numbered 591, 594, 597, and 691 must receive approval from their faculty adviser, in the form of an electronic permit, before registration. Some academic departments do require advising of their graduate students. Students should check with their respective academic departments."
