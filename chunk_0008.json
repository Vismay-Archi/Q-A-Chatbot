  "text": "Enrolled co-terminal students may transfer to another co-terminal program before the completion of their degree. Co-terminal students who wish to transfer to an equivalent degree or from a research to a professional degree within the same academic unit (M.S. to M.S., ME, or MAS; ME to ME; or MAS to MAS) may be required to complete a new co-terminal application. For certain degree programs a student may request the change by filing the Change of Degree, Major, and/or Declare Concentration, Project or Thesis form in eForms for Degree Works. Check eForms for restrictions. The change of degree request will be reviewed and approved by the proposed new co-terminal adviser and academic department before the change is recorded. Once a degree change is recorded, students are required to file a new Co-Terminal Shared and Non-Shared Courses eForm. Instructions for completing a new Co-Terminal Shared and Non- Shared Courses eForm are detailed in the Academic Planning section of this handbook. Co-terminal students who wish to transfer from a professional degree to a research degree (ME or MAS to M.S.) in the same academic unit or to a degree in a different academic unit must submit a new co-terminal application. Instructions for applying to co-terminal studies are detailed in the Applying section of this handbook. 10 Updated September 2020",
