      "text": "In 1890, when advanced education was often reserved for society’s elite, Chicago minister\nFrank Gunsaulus delivered what came to be known as the “Million Dollar Sermon.” From\nthe pulpit of his Southside church (near the site Illinois Tech now occupies), Gunsaulus\nsaid that with a million dollars he would build a school where students of all backgrounds\ncould prepare for meaningful roles in a changing industrial society. Philip Danforth Armour,\nthe Chicago meat packer and grain merchant, heard Gunsaulus’ sermon and came to\nshare the minister’s vision. He agreed to finance the endeavor with the stipulation that\nGunsaulus become the first president of the Armour Institute. When Armour opened in\n1893, the Institute offered professional courses in engineering, chemistry, architecture and\nlibrary science. Illinois Tech was created in 1940 by the merger of Armour Institute with\nLewis Institute (1895), a West Side Chicago college that offered liberal arts as well as\nscience and engineering courses. The Institute of Design, founded in 1937, merged with\nIllinois Tech in 1949.\nIn 1969, Illinois Tech became one of the few technology-based universities with a law\nschool when Chicago-Kent College of Law, founded in 1888, became an integral part of the\nuniversity. Stuart School of Business was also added in 1969 with a gift from the estate of\nLewis Institute alumnus and Chicago financier Harold Leonard Stuart. Midwest College of\nEngineering, founded in 1967, joined in 1986, forming the nucleus for Illinois Tech’s west\nsuburban campus.\nToday, Illinois Tech is a private, Ph.D. granting university, with programs in engineering,\nscience, psychology, architecture, business, design and law. One of the 17 institutions that\nconstitute the Association of Independent Technological Universities, Illinois Tech offers\nexceptional preparation for professions that require technological sophistication. Through\na committed faculty and personal attention, Illinois Tech provides challenging academic\nprograms focused by the rigor of the real world. Illinois Tech’s fourth site is Illinois Tech’s\nMoffett Campus, the location of the National Center for Food Safety and Technology, a\nmultidisciplinary food safety research facility in southwest suburban Bedford Park. A\nMaster of Science degree and a certificate program in food safety and technology are\noffered at Moffett Campus.\nStudents also may take classes through the William F. Finkl Interactive Instructional\nTelevision Network (Illinois Tech Online), which enables students to take classes at more\nthan 50 remote TV receiving sites.\nILLINOIS TECH’S MISSION\nStudent Handbook 4"

Complicity\nEncouraging, assisting, conspiring, or hiring another to engage in, or being an accessory to\nany conduct prohibited by this Code of Conduct will be considered a violation of this\npolicy.\nB. Conduct Discipline\nThe student conduct process, which exists in order to maintain the safe and efficient\noperations of Illinois Tech and to aid in advancing its academic mission, is based on the\nassumption that disciplinary procedures, when required, should aim to be an educational\nprocess, while also maintaining the safe and efficient operations of Illinois Tech and\nprotecting its community. Disciplinary sanctions are primarily imposed to help students\ndevelop individual responsibility and encourage self-discipline, to foster a respect for the\nrights of others, and to protect the rights, freedoms and safety of all members of the Illinois\nTech community. Hearings or appeals processes are not courts of law and are not\ngoverned by criminal or civil court procedures; however, the processes aim to provide for\nthe timely, fair and impartial investigation and resolution of each matter. In adjudicating\nany alleged violation(s) of the Code of Conduct, the preponderance of the evidence\nstandard is employed, meaning the facts and circumstances and reasonable inferences\ndrawn therefrom indicate that it is more likely than not the violation occurred. The only\nprocess to which a student is entitled is the process provided for in this Student\nHandbook. However, because some violations of the Code of Conduct are also violations\nof the law, students may be accountable to both law enforcement agencies and Illinois\nTech for their actions.

This provision applies only to individuals, not organizations. To be clear, this policy\nis not meant to promote unlawful drug or alcohol use among students. Rather, it is\nintended to provide a provision within the Code of Conduct to encourage responsible\nreporting to an appropriate authority when a student is in need of help. Accordingly, it is\nStudent Handbook 61"

Applicability\nThe Amnesty Policy acknowledges that as members of this community, students have a\nresponsibility to each other. Therefore, students should directly seek medical assistance\nfor another person (or for themselves) during an alcohol or other drug-related\nemergency. In such an instance, the student who seeks medical assistance will not face\ndisciplinary action for the mere possession or use of alcohol or drugs, if they remain with\nthe individual until medical assistance arrives and the person can be assisted. In order to\nqualify under the Policy, the student, after securing medical assistance, must also contact\nthe appropriate administrative department or authority. Depending on the facts and\ncircumstances, a student who seeks medical assistance for another may be required to\nmeet with a member of the Student Affairs staff and/or a counselor. As long as the student\ncomplies with all directives, they will not face disciplinary actions for the mere possession\nor use of alcohol and/or drug; failure to comply can result in the revocation of the amnesty\nand referral to the normal disciplinary process.\nb. Limits of the Amnesty Policy\nThe Amnesty Policy applies only to alcohol or other drug-related medical emergencies but\ndoes not apply to other prohibited conduct under the Code of Conduct. If other prohibited\nconduct occurs, then a student can be charged with a violation of the Code of Conduct.\nThe use and/or abuse of alcohol or drugs will not be considered a mitigating circumstance\nfor any other violation of this Code of Conduct. In cases where an individual fails to seek\nemergency medical assistance when it is clearly needed, disciplinary action may be taken\nagainst the individual.\nReporting pursuant to the Amnesty Policy will be monitored, and the Dean of Students\nretains the authority to pursue, in accordance with the Code of Conduct and applicable\nlaw, disciplinary action against and/or contact the parents of the students who abuse it.\nThe Amnesty Policy applies only to Illinois Tech’s response to a medical\nemergency.

General Statement Against Sexual Harassment\nIllinois Tech is committed to ensuring an environment for all members of its community\nthat is fair, humane, and respectful - an environment that supports and rewards student,\nfaculty and staff performance on the basis of relevant considerations such as ability and\neffort. Behaviors that inappropriately assert sexuality as relevant to student, faculty or staff\nperformance damage this environment. Sexual harassment by any member of the Illinois\nTech community is prohibited. Sexual harassment includes peer harassment among\nstudents, staff or faculty. Sexual harassment by a faculty member or teaching assistant of a\nstudent over whom they have authority or by a supervisor of a member of the faculty or\nstaff can be particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile or\nStudent Handbook 96"

Definition of Sexual Harassment\nSexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors\nand other verbal or physical conduct or communications as defined and otherwise\nprohibited by local, state and federal law. Sexual harassment can be overt and\nunambiguous or subtle and indirect. Sexual misconduct, as defined in Section N of this\nArticle, and Title IX Sex Discrimination, as defined in Appendix A, Section, are forms of\nsexual harassment. (As a reminder, complaints of and the investigation, adjudication and\nsanction of Title IX Sex Discrimination are exclusively handled pursuant to the processes\nand procedures set forth in Appendix A.) In general, sexual advances, requests for sexual\nfavors or sexually-directed remarks constitute harassment when either:\n1. The conduct directed against an individual persists despite its rejection; or\n2. Submission to the conduct is used or threatened to be used as the basis for academic or\nemployment decisions or is accompanied by an offer or reward or threats of reprisal.\nSexual harassment can take many forms. Some of these are overt and unambiguous, while\nothers may be more subtle and indirect. Direct forms of sexual harassment include sexual\nassault and sexual advances accompanied by an offer or reward or threats of reprisal.\nSuch behavior constitutes serious misconduct, and a single incident may well establish\ngrounds for a complaint. Other forms of sexual harassment include sexual advances,\nphysical or verbal, that are repeated and unwanted. Sexual harassment can also include\nbehavior or a pattern of behavior that creates a hostile environment, which generally\nincludes harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe, pervasive and objectively offensive\nthat it alters the conditions of employment or limits, interferes with or denies educational\nbenefits or opportunities, from both the perspectives of the person reporting harassment\nand from a reasonable person’s standard.\nRomantic relationships that might be appropriate in other contexts may, within a university,\ncreate the appearance or fact of an abuse of power or of undue advantage. Moreover, even\nwhen both parties have consented at the outset to a romantic involvement, such consent\ndoes not preclude a subsequent charge of sexual harassment against the instructor or\nsupervisor.\nStudent Handbook 97"

DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO SEXUAL MISCONDUCT UNDER THE CODE OF\nCONDUCT (DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT\nPROCESS ARE SET FORTH IN ARTILCE III).\na. Consent\nConsent represents the cornerstone of respectful and healthy intimate relationships.\nIllinois Tech strongly encourages its community members to communicate – openly,\nhonestly and clearly – about their actions, wishes, and intentions when it comes to sexual\nbehavior, and to do so before engaging in intimate conduct. It is always the requirement of\nthe individual initiating sexual contact (or undertaking a new type of sexual activity) to\nensure that consent is present before acting and is present during sexual activity.\nWhen determining whether consent was present, Illinois Tech will consider whether a\nreasonable person in the same circumstances should have known whether the other party\ncould or could not consent to the sexual activity. Thus, to have sex with someone who you\nknow to be, or should have known to be incapable of making a rational, reasonable\ndecision about a sexual situation is a violation of this policy. Consent is not present when\nan individual does not have the capacity to give consent, voluntarily or involuntarily, due to\nage (younger than 17 in Illinois), physical condition, or disability that impairs the\nindividual's ability to give consent. Reasons why one could lack capacity to give consent\ndue to a physical condition include, but are not limited to, incapacitation due to the\nconsumption of drugs or alcohol (voluntarily or involuntarily) or being in a state of\nunconsciousness, sleep, or other state in which the person is unaware that sexual activity\nis occurring. To be clear, a person may appear to be giving consent but may not have the\ncapacity to do so; in which case, the apparent consent is not effective. If there is any doubt\nas to another person's capacity to give consent, one should assume that the other person\ndoes not have the capacity to give consent. Being intoxicated or impaired by drugs or\nalcohol does not excuse one from the responsibility to obtain consent.\nWith the foregoing, consent means the existence of clearly understandable words or\nactions that manifest a knowing, active, voluntary, and present and ongoing agreement to\nStudent Handbook 108"

Specific Acts of Sexual Misconduct\nAs set forth in the Code of Conduct, Illinois Tech prohibits sexual misconduct. Such\nconduct violates the community values and principles of Illinois Tech and disrupts the\nliving, learning, and working environment for students, faculty, staff and other community\nmembers. Therefore, Illinois Tech's Code of Conduct prohibits the actions noted in the\nCode of Conduct as the same are defined below. An attempt to commit any such act, as\nwell as assisting or willfully encouraging any such act, is also considered a violation of the\nCode of Conduct. An act may violate one or more provisions of the Code of Conduct; thus,\nIllinois Tech reserves the right to bring multiple charges against an individual for a single\nact. As circumstances warrant, a student may also be held responsible for the misconduct\nof their visitors and guests. The terms and definitions below are important components of\nIllinois Tech's Code of Conduct. The definitions are intended to give meaning to these\nterms in the context of the Illinois Tech community.\ni.

AMNESTY FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT REPORTING PARTY AND WITNESSES\nIllinois Tech encourages reporting of sexual misconduct and seeks to remove any barriers\nto an individual making a report. To this end, Illinois Tech recognizes that an individual who\nwas drinking or using drugs at the time of such an incident may be hesitant to make a\nreport because of potential consequences for their own conduct. Accordingly, an\nindividual(s) who, in good faith, reports sexual misconduct that was directed at them or\nanother person, either as a reporting party or a third party witness, will not be subject to\ndisciplinary action by Illinois Tech solely for their own personal consumption of alcohol or\ndrugs.\nO. Sexual Offender Registration Act Compliance\nAny student who is required by the Illinois Sexual Offender Registration Act (730 ILCS 150/1\net seq.) to register is expected to do so promptly in accordance with the terms of the Act.\nWith respect to registering with Illinois Tech, such student is to register with Illinois Tech’s\nDirector of Public Safety (or designee), and appointments to so register may be made by\ncontacting the Department of Public Safety at (312) 808-6300 or by visiting its office, which\nis located at 3424 South State Street, Suite 115.

Smoking Policy\nIllinois Tech is subject to the Illinois Clean Indoor Air Act and Chicago Clean Indoor Air\nOrdinance, which stipulates that smoking, including the use of e-cigarettes and\ncomparable devices, is banned in all enclosed public places and places of employment as\nwell as student residence halls. On Illinois Tech campuses, these places include:\n Any Illinois Tech residential building;\n All enclosed workplaces;\nStudent Handbook 114"

Student Intellectual Property\n1. Work Done for Course Credit or Degree Requirement\nWork done for course credit by students, including IPROs, and work done by a student as a\ndegree requirement, including master’s theses, Ph.D. theses and comparable final\nprojects, as such theses and projects are required to be substantially the original work of\nthe students, are not considered university-owned for purposes of Illinois Tech’s copyright\nand patents policies. All such works belong exclusively to the students, and in such\nsituations, the fact that a faculty member may provide constructive criticisms, editorial\nsuggestions or other forms of guidance does not change this fact, as such undertakings are\na normal and customary part of a faculty member’s duties. Faculty or staff members\nwishing to use any such student-created work for their own purposes or for Illinois Tech\npurposes must obtain the student’s consent and, at a minimum, provide adequate credit\nto the student.\nIn general, if work done for course credit by students is a collaborative effort among a group\nof students (e.g. IPROs), meaning each such student actively participated and contributed\nto the creation of the work, then, each student will likely be deemed a creator/inventor of\nthe work, and each student will have the right to use and allow others to use the work\nStudent Handbook 115"

In any event, even absent an agreement, students should\nalways give appropriate attribution to all team members involved whenever the work is\nused or authorized for use. The foregoing is intended as merely a general statement.\nStudents must understand that the actual rights of each student participating in a\nparticular collaborative effort will ultimately be determined by applicable patent, copyright\nor other intellectual property rights statutes and the facts and circumstances of the\nparticular collaborative effort.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the course description contained in the Undergraduate or\nGraduate Bulletin clearly states language akin to the following:\n“The applicable academic unit hereby gives notice of its desire to secure a non-exclusive,\nperpetual, royalty-free license solely to use, at its discretion, student-created work\nproduced in [Insert Course Name and Number], with appropriate attribution, for its own\nnon-commercial and educational purposes, including to promote the programs of the\nacademic unit.

For\npurposes of this policy, interim safety intervention may include one or more actions\nreasonably intended to ameliorate the concerns that do not otherwise warrant involuntary\nwithdrawal hereunder; such actions may include, but are expressly not limited to, requiring\nevaluation by an appropriate healthcare professional, removal from Illinois Tech residential\nfacilities, restrictions on access to Illinois Tech property and facilities, regular meetings\nwith the Dean of Students or designee, and/or limitations on extracurricular activities\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, Illinois Tech has established a Community Support Team\n(“CST”). With respect to this policy, the primary mission of the CST is to improve\ncommunity safety through collaborative, coordinated, objective, and thoughtful\napproaches to the prevention, identification, assessment, intervention, and management\nof situations that pose, or may reasonably pose, a threat to the safety, security, and well-\nbeing of the campus community and its individual members. Therefore, CST will review and\nevaluate information regarding concerns or issues involving threats to the Illinois Tech\ncommunity by Illinois Tech students, and will act, as necessary, to protect the community\nand its members.\n2. Purpose of and Criteria for Safety Intervention and Risk Assessment. The\nprocedures for a Safety Intervention and Risk Assessment described below establish a\nfact-based investigative and analytical process for intervening with and assessing the risk\npresented by students who: (i) pose a credible substantial risk of harm to individuals within\nIllinois Tech or to the Illinois Tech community as a whole; or (ii) substantially impede the\nlawful activities, the educational process, or the proper activities or functions of other\nStudent Handbook 139"

Interim Safety Intervention or Involuntary Withdrawal. If safety is an immediate\nconcern, Illinois Tech is permitted and has the authority to take interim action to protect\nthe well-being of all members of its community, including contacting Public Safety. By\ninterim involuntary withdrawal, Illinois Tech may remove a student from any or all Illinois\nTech premises when, in the professional judgment of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs\nand Dean of Students or designee, after considering the reasonably available information,\na credible substantial threat of immediate harm to an individual or the Illinois Tech\ncommunity is perceived to exist. Interim involuntary withdrawal is a preliminary action\ntaken to protect the health and safety of the Illinois Tech community, and is not a penalty.\nA student withdrawn on an interim basis shall be given an opportunity to appear personally\nbefore the Vice Provost of Student Affairs and Dean of Students or designee within two (2)\nbusiness days from the effective date of the interim involuntary withdrawal, in order to\ndiscuss the reliability of the information concerning the student’s behavior. Following this\nmeeting, the Vice Provost of Student Affairs and Dean of Students or designee for the\ncampus may either continue or cancel the interim involuntary withdrawal.\nIf the interim involuntary withdrawal is canceled, the procedures described in this policy\nregarding Safety Intervention and Involuntary Withdrawal may still proceed. An interim\ninvoluntary withdrawal may remain in effect until a final decision is made pursuant to the\nprocedures outlined in this policy.\n4. Threat Assessment and Safety Committee. The CST assists in evaluating whether\nstudents meet the criteria for Safety Intervention and/or Involuntary Withdrawal. The CST\nwill generally include representatives from the offices of Academic Affairs, Office of\nStudent Affairs, Disability Resources, General Counsel, Human Resources, Public Safety,\nResidence Life, Student Health and Wellness Center as well as a member of the faculty.\nOther members may be added at the discretion of the Provost or Vice Provost of Student\nAffairs and Dean of Students.

No person shall, on the basis\nof sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\nIt is the intention and commitment of Illinois Tech to not discriminate on the basis of sex in\nour educational program or activities.

This policy is effective as of January 9, 2025, and will\nalso be used to resolve reports before January 9, 2025.\nA. TITLE IX DEFINITIONS\nThe following terms have the following definitions as used in this Title IX sex\ndiscrimination/sex-based harassment grievance process:\nI. ACTUAL KNOWLDEGE\nActual Knowledge in Title IX refers to the notice of alleged sex discrimination/sex-\nbased harassment to the Title IX Coordinator or designee or to any Responsible\nEmployee at Illinois Tech. Assumption of knowledge based solely on Illinois Tech’s\nstatus as an employer or other presumption under the law does not constitute Actual\nKnowledge.

CONFIDENTIAL ADVISERS\nConfidential Advisors are the only individuals who generally have an obligation to\nmaintain privacy and confidentiality and not to report information that they may learn\nregarding sex discrimination/sex-based harassment. In addition, Illinois law has\nestablished the recognized role of Confidential Advisor, which is an individual\nretained by a higher education institution that has certain mandated training and has\nthe duty and ability to provide emergency and ongoing support to students who have\nexperienced sex discrimination/sex-based harassment.

Staff members of\nthe Student Health and Wellness Center, whose official responsibilities include providing mental\nhealth counseling to members of the student body, when acting within the scope of their license\nor certification, are generally obligated by law to maintain confidentiality, and these individuals\nwhen so acting are not required by law to report information they come to learn regarding\nalleged criminal offenses, including some sex discrimination/sex-based harassment.\n3. CONSENT\nConsent represents the cornerstone of respectful and healthy intimate relationships.\nIllinois Tech strongly encourages its community members to communicate – openly,\nhonestly, and clearly – about their actions, wishes, and intentions when it comes to\nsexual behavior, and to do so before engaging in sexual behavior or other forms of\nintimate conduct. It is always the requirement of the individual initiating intimate\nconduct (or undertaking a new type of sexual behavior) to ensure that consent is\npresent before acting and is present during the intimate conduct.\nWhen determining whether consent was present, Illinois Tech will consider whether\na reasonable person in the same circumstances should have known whether the other\nparty could or could not consent to the sexual activity. Thus, to have sex with someone\nwho you know to be, or should have known to be incapable of knowingly, voluntarily,\nand clearly giving permission, by words and/or actions to engage in sexual behavior\nis a violation of this policy. Consent is not present when an individual cannot give\npermission, voluntarily or involuntarily, due to age (younger than 17 in Illinois),\nphysical condition, or disability that impairs the individual's ability to give consent.\nReasons why one could lack the capacity to give consent due to a physical condition\ninclude, but are not limited to, incapacitation due to the consumption of drugs or\nalcohol (voluntarily or involuntarily) or being in a state of unconsciousness, sleep, or\nother state in which the person is unaware that sexual activity is occurring.

This means that silence, passivity,\nsubmission, or the lack of verbal or physical resistance (including the\nlack of a \"no\") should not - in and of itself - be understood as consent.\nConsent cannot be inferred by an individual's manner of dress, the giving\nor acceptance of gifts, the extension or acceptance of an invitation to go\nto a private room or location, or going on a date.\no Voluntary: Consent must be freely given and cannot be the result of force\n(violence, physical restraint, or the presence of a weapon); threat or\ncoercion (defined below); or fraud (misrepresentation or material\nomission about oneself or the present situation in order to gain\npermission for sexual or intimate activity).\no Present and ongoing: Consent must exist at the time of the sexual or\nintimate activity. Consent to previous sexual or intimate activity does not\nimply consent to later sexual or intimate acts; similarly, consent to one\ntype of sexual or intimate activity does not imply consent to other sexual\nor intimate acts. Consent may also be withdrawn at any time by the\nperson making known, by articulated word or concrete action, his or her\nintention to withdraw it, and thereupon, the sexual or intimate activity\nshould immediately cease.\no Threat or Coercion: The direct or implied threat of force, violence,\ndanger, hardship, or retribution sufficient to persuade a reasonable\nperson one would have to submit. Coercive behavior differs from\nseductive behavior based on the type of pressure someone uses to get\nconsent from another. A person's words or conduct cannot amount to\ncoercion unless they wrongfully impair the other's freedom of will or\nability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. When\nsomeone makes it clear that they do not want to engage in sexual activity,\nthat they want to stop, or they do not want to go past a certain point of\nsexual interaction, continued pressure beyond that point can be\nthreatening or coercive.\no Incapacitation: The inability to understand the nature of the activity or\nto give knowing consent. Incapacitation is also the inability to\nunderstand the “who, what, when, where, & how” of the intimate conduct\n3"

      "text": "4. THE PROCESS USED TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE A FORMAL TITLE IX\nCOMPLAINT WILL ALSO MEET THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL\nREQUIREMENTS:\nXVIII. The process used must treat complainants and respondents equitably in all manners,\nincluding by providing remedies to a complainant where a determination of\nresponsibility for sex discrimination and sex-based harassment has been made\nagainst the respondent, and by following this sex discrimination and sex-based\nharassment process before the imposition of any disciplinary sanctions or other\nactions that are not Supportive Measures against a respondent.\nXIX. No evidence that constitutes or seeks disclosure of information protected under a\nlegally recognized privilege will be required, allowed, or relied on unless the person\nholding such privilege has waived the privilege.\nXX. The Title IX Investigator and the Title IX Decision-Maker will objectively review all\nrelevant evidence, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, and\ncredibility determinations will not be based on a person’s status as a complainant,\nrespondent, or witness.\nXXI. All members of the Title IX Team will operate under a presumption that the\nrespondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding\nresponsibility is made at the conclusion of this grievance process.\nXXII. Remedies may include, but are not limited to, the same individualized services\ndescribed as Supportive Measures in this policy but need not be non-disciplinary or\nnon-punitive and need not avoid burdening the respondent. Student discipline can\ninvolve a range of consequences, which may include, but are not limited to,\nSupportive Measures, a warning, probation, suspension and expulsion, depending on\nthe severity of the action and circumstances of the student(s) involved. For the\navoidance of doubt, the Title IX Decision-maker may impose any sanction provided\nfor in this policy upon which a respondent is found responsible, after a live hearing,\nfor sex discrimination/sex-based harassment. Discipline for employees also includes\na range of options, including, but not limited to, a letter of reprimand, reassignment,\nsuspension with or without pay, discharge or recommendation for discharge,\nnotifying appropriate legal authorities and/or taking legal action against the\nemployee.\nXXIII. The Title IX Coordinator or designee may consolidate Formal Title IX Complaints as\nto allegations of sex discrimination/sex-based harassment against more than one\nrespondent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respondents, or\nby one party against the other party, where the allegations of sex discrimination/sex-\nbased harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances.\nXXIV. E-mail correspondence sent to a student’s registered iit.edu e-mail address (or, in the\ncase of a non-Illinois Tech student, such e-mail address as they shall provide) will be\nconsidered sufficient written notification in all instances where written notification\nis required under this policy. It is the party’s sole responsibility to monitor their\nemail. The date any such notification is e-mailed will serve as the start date for any\ntime period within which or after which any subsequent action or proceeding is to\ncommence. Illinois Tech’s sole obligation is to send notice to the complainant and\nrespondent and witness; Illinois Tech shall have no obligation also to communicate\nwith the advisors or parents or other representatives of such parties.\n15"

Designation of Decision-maker: The Title IX Coordinator or designee will identify\none Title IX Decision-maker for the Formal Title IX Complaint, which cannot include\nthe Title IX Coordinator or designee, or the Title IX Investigator or Title IX Informal\nResolution Facilitator, if any, assigned to the Formal Title IX Complaint.\nXXVI. Live Hearing: A live hearing will be provided as part of the sex discrimination/sex-\nbased harassment process. The live hearing will comply with the following\nrequirements:\nXXVII. The live hearing may, upon the request of either the complainant or the respondent,\nbe held virtually, with parties located in separate rooms with technology enabling the\nTitle IX Decision-Maker and parties to simultaneously see and hear the party or\nwitness answering questions. Any live hearing may, at the discretion of the Title IX\nDecision-Maker, also be held virtually as outlined above. Unless the live hearing is\nconducted virtually, all parties must be physically present in the same geographic\nlocation.\nXXVIII. All hearings will be documented through audio recording, audiovisual recording, or\ntranscript, at Illinois Tech’s discretion, and will be made available to the parties for\ninspection or review.\nXXIX. At the hearing, the Title IX Decision-Maker must permit each party’s advisor to ask\nthe other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions,\nincluding those that challenge credibility; such questions are referred to as “cross-\nexamination.” Only relevant cross-examination may be asked of a party or witness.\nWith respect to cross-examination:\nXXX. Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual\nbehavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the\ncomplainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the\nrespondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions\nand evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior\nwith respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent.\nXXXI. The Title IX Decision-Maker must explain to the party proposing the questions any\ndecision to exclude a question as not relevant.\nXXXII. Cross-examination at the live hearing must be conducted by the party’s advisor, and\nnever by the party. If a party does not have an advisor present at the live hearing,\nIllinois Tech will provide an advisor of its choice, without charge to the party, who\nmay be, but likely not will be, an attorney to conduct cross-examination on behalf of\nthe party.\nXXXIII. If a party or witness does not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing, the Title\nIX Decision-Maker may still consider and rely on any statement of that party or\nwitness in reaching a determination regarding responsibility. However, the Decision-\nMaker cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility\nbased solely on the party or witness’s absence or refusal to answer cross-examination\nor other questions.\nXXXIV. Burdens: Illinois Tech, as the party bearing the burden of proof during the\ninvestigation and adjudication of Formal Title IX Complaints, will meet this burden\n16"

All such statements are to be made by the\ncomplainant and respondent; advisors may not make such statements on their\nbehalf.\nXXXVI. Live Hearing Procedures. The Title IX Decision-Maker may establish rules for the\nlive hearing, which may include, but are not limited to, governing decorum, setting\ntime limits for opening and closing remarks, empowering the Title IX Decision-Maker\nto take a temporary recess, and any such other rules deemed prudent for the effective\nand efficient conduct of the live hearing; provided, however, any such rules must be\nconsistent with this policy and must apply equally to the complainant and\nrespondent. Any rules applicable to the hearing will be included in the notice of\nhearing.\nXXXVII.
