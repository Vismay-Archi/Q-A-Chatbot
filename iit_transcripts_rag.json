This change incorporates credit hours, grades, quality points, and term grade-point average from the formerly separate master's and doctoral levels into a single graduate level moving forward. As a result, a recalculated cumulative grade-point average for combined master's and doctoral level credit appears on the official transcript. Credit earned at the graduate business or law levels remain separate and are not affected by this change."
