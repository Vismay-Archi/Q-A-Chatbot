  "text": "V. INFORMAL RESOLUTION. As provided for herein, if the complainant and respondent\nand Illinois Tech each freely agree, Illinois Tech will offer the option to participate in\na voluntary informal resolution process in an attempt to resolve allegations of Title\nIX sex discrimination/sex-based harassment; provided, however, if a Formal Title IX\nComplaint involves an allegation of sex discrimination/sex-based harassment by an\nIllinois Tech employee against a student, then informal resolution is not an available\noption.\nThe Title IX Investigator will, within 7 calendar days of assignment to the Formal Title\nIX Complaint, notify, in writing, the complainant and respondent of the option to\ncomplete informal resolution, which will, among other things, set forth (i) the\nallegations; (ii) the requirements of the informal resolution process, including the\ncircumstances under which it precludes the parties from resuming a Formal Title IX\nComplaint arising from the same allegations, provided, however, that at any time\nprior to agreeing to a resolution, any party has the right to withdraw from the\ninformal resolution process and resume the sex discrimination/sex-based\nharassment process with respect to the Formal Title IX Complaint; and (iii) any\nconsequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process,\nincluding the records that will be maintained or could be shared. The complainant\nand respondent may elect to participate in an informal resolution process at any time\nprior to a determination regarding responsibility for the allegation(s) in the Formal\nTitle IX Complaint being rendered. Further, either the complainant or respondent\nmay at any time, prior to execution of a resolution agreement, request the informal\nresolution process be terminated by so notifying the Title IX Informal Resolution\nFacilitator, in which case processing of the Formal Title IX Complaint under this policy\nwill recommence.\nIllinois Tech states that it does not require - as a condition of enrollment or continuing\nenrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other\nright - waiver of the right to an investigation and adjudication of Formal Title IX\nComplaints of sex discrimination/sex-based harassment consistent with this policy.\nAs noted, the informal resolution process is voluntary and requires written consent\nfrom the complainant and respondent. The informal resolution process can only be\ninitiated once a Formal Title IX Complaint has been filed with the Title IX Coordinator.\nUpon receipt of signed, voluntary consents to participate in the informal resolution\nprocess, the Title IX Coordinator or designee will designate a Title IX Informal\nResolution Facilitator to facilitate the informal resolution process. To maintain the\nintegrity and impartiality of the informal resolution process, a Title IX Informal\nResolution Facilitator may not be called to testify, at any live hearing convened\npursuant to this policy, as to any matter related to any informal resolution process to\nwhich the Title IX Informal Resolution Facilitator has been assigned.\nDuring the informal resolution process, all timeframes under this sex\ndiscrimination/sex-based harassment process will be tolled. If no resolution is\nreached within 45 calendar days of commencement of the informal resolution,\nmeaning the day after the Title IX Informal Resolution Facilitator has been assigned,\nthen, unless such 45-day time period is extended by agreement of the parties, or if the\nparties cease to engage in informal resolution, the sex discrimination/sex-based\nharassment process and its timeframes will thereafter recommence where it left off.\nIn general, an informal resolution process will aim to restore a sense of safety to one\nwho experienced harm, restore or maintain access to educational and/or\nemployment opportunities, and/or in some instances repair harm. To this end,\n12",
