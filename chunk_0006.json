  "text": "Like all undergraduate students, co-terminal degree-seeking students who wish to withdraw from the university with the intention of returning to complete their degree program may apply for a leave of absence. All requests for a leave of absence begin with the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs. A leave of absence cannot exceed one academic year, however it may be extended if the proper documentation is submitted. Students will still be considered part of the Illinois Tech community while on a leave and any Illinois Tech scholarships will be held until the student’s return. Students returning from a medical leave of absence are required to submit appropriate documentation from their medical provider. Please contact the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs for more information. International students must comply with additional regulations when requesting a leave of absence. Please contact the International Center with any questions regarding this issue. For more information on leaves of absence, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs (ugaa@iit.edu or 312.567.3300). NOTE ON DEGREE COMPLETION: All co-terminal degree requirements must be completed within six years of undergraduate matriculation, or the student will be dismissed from the co-terminal degree program. Time elapsed during a student’s leave of absence will not extend the total allowed time for co-terminal degree completion; it will remain six years. 9 Updated September 2020",
