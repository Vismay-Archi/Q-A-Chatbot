    "Online submissions of final grades are due on the published deadline following final exams. Grades of X are posted for all missing (blank) grades at that time and are resolved through the grade change process. All grade changes are initiated by the instructor of record or authorized academic officer. Current temporary grades of I, R, and X can be changed by the instructor directly with the Office of the Registrar to a final letter grade of: A, B, C, D, E, or S/U, if the course has a pass/fail grading basis of satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Temporary grades of I or R cannot be changed to another temporary or a non-letter, administrative grade of: I, R, NA, AU, W, or X. Other grade changes may require an additional level of approval by an academic officer or appeals committee. Changes to final grades cannot be made once a degree has been posted for the course of study in which the course was taken, or in the case of a student’s involuntary separation from the university.",

Grades of X are posted for all missing (blank) grades at that time and are resolved through the grade change process. All grade changes are initiated by the instructor of record or authorized academic officer. Current temporary grades of I, R, and X can be changed by the instructor directly with the Office of the Registrar to a final letter grade of: A, B, C, D, E, or S/U, if the course has a pass/fail grading basis of satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Temporary grades of I or R cannot be changed to another temporary or a non-letter, administrative grade of: I, R, NA, AU, W, or X. Other grade changes may require an additional level of approval by an academic officer or appeals committee. Changes to final grades cannot be made once a degree has been posted for the course of study in which the course was taken, or in the case of a student’s involuntary separation from the university. Note: This does not apply to Chicago-Kent College of Law. Historical Grade Legends For your reference, historical grade legends are made available on our Registrar Archives page. Learn more...
