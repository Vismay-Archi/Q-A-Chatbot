Section 20(a) of the Act requires that, beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, institutions of higher education have a policy instituting a physical or financial hardship withdrawal process. According to the Act, the process must work to limit debt owed by students who have to withdraw from the institution due to a significant physical or financial hardship and to assist those students if and when they choose to re-enroll.",
        "A hardship withdrawal is an unforeseeable circumstance that occurred after the semester began (often after the midpoint) which had a significant impact on the student's ability to continue in the course(s) and be successful. A hardship may be due to a physical, mental, emotional, or psychological condition."
