Please contact us via the program support email so that your instructor and TA can investigate and fix the issue as needed.\nWhen will I see my final grade on my transcript?\nYou should be able to see your final letter grades the day after the official grade submission deadline each term. You can find the final grade entry deadline information on\nthe Coursera Academic Calendar\n.\nMy degree dashboard in Coursera shows the course as “Completed,” but I got an E. What should I do?\nCompletion status in Coursera only means you have submitted or viewed all course content. It does not guarantee a passing grade. Final grades on the\nIllinois Tech Portal\nreflect performance based on course requirements. If you think the final grade on the portal is not correct, please contact us via the program support email.\nWhat is “performance-based admissions (PBA)?”\nThe performance-based admissions process prepares capable learners to start their next educational journey. You don’t need transcripts, tests, application fees, or other hurdles to begin taking classes. If you pass the initial “pathway courses” with a B or higher grade and fulfill program requirements, you will be automatically admitted to the program you have applied for.\nFulfillment of program requirements includes submission of transcripts prior to graduation.\nWhat is the transfer credit policy?\nAll Bachelor of Information Technology students must submit official transcripts in order for the Office of Undergraduate Admission to evaluate your transfer course credits. Unofficial transcripts will not be accepted. Please have your previous institution send your transcripts to\nadmission@illinoistech.edu\nfor review. Our office will evaluate your transfer credit within five business days after receiving your official transcripts.\nWhat is the transfer policy for the Bachelor of IT program?\nIf you have a transcript from an international institution, you must provide: 1) course evaluations from a NACES- or AICE-accredited association, 2) course descriptions, and 3) certified English translations of your materials if they are in a language other than English. These documents must be submitted for all international transcripts before we can evaluate your transcript for course credit.\nTransfer credit is not permitted for the three graduate-level programs, except for approved industry certificates (IPC) for two of our programs. More detailed information about the approved industry certificates can be found on the\nprofessional certificate information website\n.\nIs there a way to evaluate my prior learning credit before I start PBA courses for the Bachelor of Information Technology?\nYes. If you are a domestic student, you can request a Pre-Enrollment transfer credit evaluation even before you enroll in the PBA courses by following\nthe instructions on Pre-Enrollment Transfer Credit Evaluation\n. However, please note that this is not an official credit evaluation. You will need to request an official evaluation by submitting your official transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission once you are admitted to the program.\nI’m a current Illinois Tech student and I’m interested in transferring to one of the Coursera programs. How do I do that?\nCoursera programs are an exclusive arrangement and are not available to existing Illinois Tech students. Likewise, a student who wishes to transfer from a Coursera program to a non-Coursera program at Illinois Tech must reapply to the new program and meet all admission criteria.

She holds a B.A. in psychology and an M.A. in counseling from the University of Arizona. She has a strong background in behavioral health and worked as a mental health therapist with a diverse range of clients, which enriches her ability to provide holistic support to students from diverse backgrounds. She also has experience as an academic adviser for undergraduate students prior to joining Illinois Tech. In addition, Yumiko’s personal journey as an international student herself allows her to become a better advocate for students from various backgrounds and enhance their experience at Illinois Tech.",
