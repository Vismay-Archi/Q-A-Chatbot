  "text": "so; in which case, the apparent consent is not effective. If there is any doubt as to\nanother person's capacity to give consent, one should assume that the other person\ndoes not have the capacity to give consent. Being intoxicated or impaired by drugs or\nalcohol does not excuse one from the responsibility to obtain consent.\nWith the foregoing, consent means the existence of clearly understandable words or\nactions that manifest a knowing, active, voluntary, and present and ongoing\nagreement to engage in specific sexual behavior or intimate conduct by one not\nsuffering from incapacitation (as defined below). Consent must be all of the following:\no Knowing: Consent must demonstrate that all individuals are in a state of\nmind to understand, to be aware of, and to agree to the \"who\" (same\npartners), \"what\" (same acts), \"where\" (same location), \"when\" (same\ntime), and \"how\" (the same way and under the same conditions) of sexual\nor intimate activity.\no Active: Consent must be communicated in clearly understandable words\nor actions that reveal one's expectations and agreement to engage in\nspecific sexual or intimate activity. This means that silence, passivity,\nsubmission, or the lack of verbal or physical resistance (including the\nlack of a \"no\") should not - in and of itself - be understood as consent.\nConsent cannot be inferred by an individual's manner of dress, the giving\nor acceptance of gifts, the extension or acceptance of an invitation to go\nto a private room or location, or going on a date.\no Voluntary: Consent must be freely given and cannot be the result of force\n(violence, physical restraint, or the presence of a weapon); threat or\ncoercion (defined below); or fraud (misrepresentation or material\nomission about oneself or the present situation in order to gain\npermission for sexual or intimate activity).\no Present and ongoing: Consent must exist at the time of the sexual or\nintimate activity. Consent to previous sexual or intimate activity does not\nimply consent to later sexual or intimate acts; similarly, consent to one\ntype of sexual or intimate activity does not imply consent to other sexual\nor intimate acts. Consent may also be withdrawn at any time by the\nperson making known, by articulated word or concrete action, his or her\nintention to withdraw it, and thereupon, the sexual or intimate activity\nshould immediately cease.\no Threat or Coercion: The direct or implied threat of force, violence,\ndanger, hardship, or retribution sufficient to persuade a reasonable\nperson one would have to submit. Coercive behavior differs from\nseductive behavior based on the type of pressure someone uses to get\nconsent from another. A person's words or conduct cannot amount to\ncoercion unless they wrongfully impair the other's freedom of will or\nability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. When\nsomeone makes it clear that they do not want to engage in sexual activity,\nthat they want to stop, or they do not want to go past a certain point of\nsexual interaction, continued pressure beyond that point can be\nthreatening or coercive.\no Incapacitation: The inability to understand the nature of the activity or\nto give knowing consent. Incapacitation is also the inability to\nunderstand the “who, what, when, where, & how” of the intimate conduct\n3\n\nthat took place. When a person is sufficiently intoxicated, high,\nintellectually disabled, or the like such that the person is not capable of\nappreciating what is happening establishes incapacitation. The legal\ninability to give effective consent because of age or declared\nincompetent.\n4. DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS\nAre consequences imposed on a respondent after a determination has been made that\nthe respondent has violated Illinois Tech’s Title IX prohibition on sex discrimination,\nincluding sex-based harassment.\n5. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM or ACTIVITY\nLocations, events, or circumstances in the United States over which Illinois Tech\nexercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which Title\nIX sex discrimination/sex-based harassment occurs, and also includes any building\nowned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by Illinois\nTech. Depending on the facts, such as whether it was an Illinois Tech sponsored\nevent, this phrase may extend to off-campus reports occurring in the United States.\n6. EMERGENCY REMOVAL/ LEAVE OF ABSENCE\nIllinois Tech may, after receiving Actual Knowledge or a Formal Title IX Complaint,\nremove a student respondent from its education program or activity on an emergency\nbasis, provided Illinois Tech makes an individualized safety and risk analysis and\ndetermines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student\nor other individual arising from the allegations of sex discrimination/sex-based\nharassment justifies removal, and provides the respondent with notice and an\nopportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal. Illinois\nTech may place a non-student employee Title IX Respondent on paid administrative\nleave during the pendency of this Title IX sex discrimination/sex-based harassment\nprocess. Such emergency removals/leaves of absence must comply with any other\nrelevant laws, policies, administrative procedures, and agreements governing\nremovals of students and/or employees from the institution’s program or activity.\nIII.\n7. FORMAL TITLE IX COMPLAINT\nA document filed by a complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sex\ndiscrimination/sex-based harassment against a respondent and requesting that\nIllinois Tech investigate the allegation.\nAt the time of filing a Formal Title IX Complaint, the complainant must be\nparticipating in or attempting to participate in Illinois Tech’s education program or\nactivity within which the formal complaint is filed.\nA complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or submitted\nelectronically by email or using the Illinois Community Reporting Form - Incident\nReport that contains the complainant’s physical or digital signature or otherwise\nindicates that the complainant is the person filing the complaint.\n4",
